pyDeltaRCM is the Python version of the `Matlab deltaRCM <https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:DeltaRCM>`_ model by Man Liang.

Installation
############

To install this package into an existing Python 3.x environment, download or clone the repository and run:

.. code:: bash

    $ python setup.py install

Or for a developer installation run:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install -e .


Executing the model
###################

We recommend you check out our `pyDeltaRCM in 10 minutes tutorial <https://deltarcm.org/pyDeltaRCM_WMT/guides/10min.html>`_, which is part of our documentation.

Additionally, the model can be run with example script ``run_pyDeltaRCM.py``:

.. code::bash
    $ python run_pyDeltaRCM.py

This reads the input file ``tests/test.yaml`` and runs a 1 timestep simulation. 
This script will create an output folder in the working directory and save a PNG file of the parameter ``eta`` (surface elevation) every 50 timesteps.
