summary: "PyDeltaRCM is the Python version of <a
  href='http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:DeltaRCM'>DeltaRCM</a> by
  Man Liang. DeltaRCM is a parcel-based cellular flux routing and
  sediment transport model for the formation of river deltas, which
  belongs to the broad category of rule-based exploratory models. It
  has the ability to resolve emergent channel behaviors including
  channel bifurcation, avulsion and migration. Sediment transport
  distinguishes two types of sediment: sand and mud, which have
  different transport and deposition/erosion rules. Stratigraphy is
  recorded as the sand fraction in layers. Best usage of DeltaRCM is
  the investigation of autogenic processes in response to external
  forcings."
